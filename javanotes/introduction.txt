Types of languages - 
1.Procedural:-
	* specifies a series of well-structured steps and procedures to compare a program.
	* contains a systematic order of statements, functions and commands to complete a task.
2.Functional:-
	* Writing a program only in pure functions i.e. never modify variables, but only create new ones as an output.
	* Used in situations where we have to perform lots of different operations on the same set of data , like ML
	* First class functions?
3.Object Oriented:-
	* Revolves around objects
	* Code + Data = Object
	* Developed to make it easier to develop,reuse,and maintain software.


Static V/S  Dynamic Languages

Static 							Dynamic
-perform type checking at compile time			- Perform type checking at runtime
-errors will show at compile time			- Error might not show till program is run
-Declare datatype before you use it			- No need to declare datatype of variables
-More control						- Saves Time in writing code but might give error at runtime	

Memory:-
Static and Heap
