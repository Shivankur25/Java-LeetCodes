How JAVA code excutes

.java file	    ------------>  .class file    ------------------>  Machine Code
(human readable)    compiler       (bytecode)      interpreter         (0 & 1)
                   (byte code)			  (line by line)
 

this is the source code      -this code will not directly          
				run on a system	
		             - we need JVM to run this
		     	     - Reason why JAVA is platform independent 


		*PLATFORM INDEPENDENCE*
 - It means that byte code can run all operating Systems.
 - We need to convert the source code to machine code so computer can understand
 - Compiler helps in doing this by turning in into executable code.
 - this excuetable code is a set of instruction for the computer
 - After compiling C/C++ code we get .exe file which is platform dependent
 - In JAVA we get bytecode, JVM converts this machine code
 - Java is platform independent but JVM is platform dependent.
